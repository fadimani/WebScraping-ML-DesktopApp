# Web Scraping and Machine Learning Application

In our modern world, data is one of the most valuable assets and that is why we have decided
to create this data scraping and machine learning application using what we have learned in
java.
Using data scraped from job listing websites we have trained machine learning models in hope
of creating an app that allows us to predict certain aspects of the job market.
We have chosen to train our machine learning model on predicting the country of the post based
on information given to it.
We believe this will prove indispensable when studying the job market disparities between
countries in macro-economic reports.
